    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Open source Python library for NLP with a focus on Topic Modelling.**\n",
    "* Tool for discovering semantic structure of documents by examining the patterns of words.\n",
    "* Retrieves semantically similar documents\n",
    "* Vector Space Modelling and Topic Modelling toolkit\n",
    "* Uses NumPy, SciPy and optionally Cython\n",
    "* Specifically designed to handle large text collections\n",
    "\n",
    "> Gensim includes implementations of tf-idf, random projections, word2vec and document2vec algorithms, hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP), latent semantic analysis (LSA, LSI, SVD) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), including distributed parallel versions.\n",
